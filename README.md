Initial Proposal

Name of Project: Good Wood<br>
Application Overview:<br>
What problem does your application solve?<br> It allows arborists and woodworkers to connect. This will save both parties money. Arborists have to pay to dump logs, and woodworkers can end up paying an arm and a leg for a decent slab.<br>
How will your application work?<br> Arborists will post the day of the job, the type of tree they are taking down, and an approximation of how many cords of wood they will have. A woodworker will then be able to browse the available trees and claim one if they choose<br>
Features?<br>
arborists can post a wood drop.<br>
the drop will display the type of wood, the location, an approximation of number of cords of wood, and the contact info needed to arrange a pickup.<br> 
Why do you want to build this application?<br>
As a woodworker, I often have trouble finding enough quality wood to stay busy.<br>
Who are the target users of this application?<br>
Targeted users will be arborists and woodworkers<br>
Will you have multiple types of users? If so, what can each type of user do?<br>
I will have two types, Arborists and woodworkers. Arborists can post a job, and a woodworker can claim it.
